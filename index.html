        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much." (CITE BOOK) These are the opening lines of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, the first book of J.K. Rowling’s best-selling book series of all time, Harry Potter. As of 2017, the series had sold over 500 million copies worldwide, had been translated in over 70 languages, and has arguably only ever been outsold by The Bible and The Red Book<sup><a href="#cite">1</a></sup>. Despite the book’s clear universal appeal, since its release reviewers have insisted on labeling the series as children’s or young adult books, distinct from adult or “regular fiction”<sup><a href="#cite">2</a></sup>. This intentional choice of words, while perhaps at first only appears as an attempt at categorization, reveals an undercurrent of bias against young adult literature and a widespread insistence on the inferiority of the genre. Young adult fiction has long been dismissed by adults, reviewers, and academics as trite, second-rate literature that is a shadow of the real thing that readers get when they grow up. Articles such as this one from Slate<sup><a href="#cite">3</a></sup> are common and encapsulate the general attitude towards young adult fiction; “Read whatever you want. But you should feel embarrassed when what you’re reading was written for children”. According to this article, a 2012 survey revealed that 55% of young adult books are bought by people over the age of 18. A more recent estimate projects that upwards of 70% of young adult books are purchased by adults aged 18-64<sup><a href="#cite">4</a></sup>. So why is this a big deal, and why do people care so much? The Pittsburgh Data Crew wanted to know and we were ready to do some digging to find out. Our curiosity about this question led us on a quest to gather data on representative samples of young adult and general fiction books, with the initial purpose of analyzing their reviews. While we did find some noteworthy information along those lines, other data that we collected also produced curious results which have helped us mount an information-driven defense of young adult literature.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>History of the Genre</h2>
        <p>Let’s start with a brief history of the young adult genre. The roots of young adult literature actually begin with the invention of “teenager” as a social demographic. For much of recorded human history, (western) civilizations did not recognize any kind of transition period between childhood and adulthood. Once a child was old enough to help around the house and contribute to the family trade, they were considered an adult. Broadly speaking, the young adult distinction was a result of the marketing boom in the mid-twentieth century when advertisers were working to break down social understandings of demographics into distinct categories that could each be targeted differently in ad space. Within literature, the term “young adult” was coined by the Young Adult Library Services Association in the 1960s to represent a newly emerging genre of literature specifically targeted to 12-18 year olds. The first golden age of YA literature boasts household names such as Judy Blume, Lois Duncan and Robert Cormier. After a brief dip in publications directed at young adults because of low birth rates in that late 70s, the baby boom of the 90s ushered in the second golden age of young adult literature at the turn of the century. Teens were inundated with scores of books marketed directly towards them and they ate it up. The immense and timely success of the Harry Potter series paved the ways for other gangbuster successes such as Twilight and The Hunger Games. Fantasy and the supernatural proliferated the genre, a phenomenon observed by many. Jennifer Lynn Barnes, a young adult author, Ph.D., and cognitive science scholar observed, "just like adolescence is between childhood and adulthood, paranormal, or other, is between human and supernatural… Teens are caught between two worlds, childhood and adulthood, and in YA, they can navigate those two worlds and sometimes dualities of other worlds."<sup><a href="#cite">5</a></sup> Other hallmarks of the genre include love triangles, dystopia, thinly veiled metaphors for the struggle between good vs evil, absent parents, and the discovery of previously unknown abilities. While the young adult reader may not end up saving the world or discovering that they have superpowers, these books allow them to work through the complicated emotions and the tensions of their transitory life stage. According to the Young Adult Library Services association,</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">“young adult literature is made valuable not only by its artistry but also by its relevance to the lives of its readers…. [it offers] readers an opportunity to see themselves reflected in its pages. Young adulthood is, intrinsically, a period of tension. On the one hand young adults have an all-consuming need to belong. But on the other, they are also inherently solipsistic, regarding themselves as being unique, which – for them — is not cause for celebration but, rather, for despair. For to be unique is to be unlike one’s peers, to be “other,” in fact. And to be “other” is to not belong but, instead, to be outcast. Thus, to see oneself in the pages of a young adult book is to receive the reassurance that one is not alone after all, not other, not alien but, instead, a viable part of a larger community of beings who share a common humanity”<sup><a href="#cite">6</a></sup></blockquote>
        <p>The themes of young adult literature, however seemingly repetitive or far-flung, allow its readers to process complicated emotions and desires to belong amidst the pages of battles far greater than anything they will ever have to face in reality. Additionally, research has shown that reading fiction has the potential to increase empathy in readers<sup><a href="#cite">7</a></sup> and the often emotionally fraught stories in young adult novels not only help young readers process their own emotions, but become more sensitive to the feelings of others.</p>
        <p>Why, then, is the genre so quickly dismissed by so many writers and adult readers? Samantha Shannon, a young adult author commented on this phenomenon saying, “There's this bizarre idea that adults can't empathise with teenagers - even that there's something embarrassing about reading books about young people.” Not only is the immediate dismissal of young adult literature fundamentally insulting to a whole group of authors and readers, to Shannon it “indicates to [her] that they're saying there's something fundamentally embarrassing about being a teenager.”<sup><a href="#cite">8</a></sup> Our question, then, is does this attitude and general dislike of young adult literature reflect in the book’s reviews? Is there a measurable difference between the reviews of young adult and general fiction reviews and could other quantifiable information tell us more about this genre divide? Here’s what we found:</p>

        <h2>Discuss the book data - everything we have recorded beyond the reviews</h2>
        <p>Before we get to the review data, there are some interesting patterns and data points that emerged amongst the basic data that we collected about the books themselves. On average, the general fiction books were longer; the average number of pages for the young adult books was 281 while for the general fiction it was 361. For some, length correlates to the caliber of the literature so this metric would prove some kind of superiority amongst the adult fiction. But book length in and of itself cannot be a measure of the book’s “literary-ness” as <em>Animal Farm</em> comes in at 144 pages whereas the book that provided the inspiration for the movie <em>Tarzan</em> by Edgar Rice Burroughs is 400 pages long.</p>
        <p>Another interesting metric comes from the locations where the books were published. 71% of the books on the young adult fiction list were published in the United States whereas only the number is only 59% for the general fiction. Both of these percentages is more than half, which is no surprise considering the lists were published by an United States-based media outlet and focused on English literature from the last century or so, however the 12% difference is still significant. The young adult book market is more concentrated on the United States than general fiction, which is no surprise considering the history of the genre. Many themes in young adult literature revolve around independence and individuality, both distinctly American ideologies. The market for young adult media is expanding, especially as movie adaptations of YA books consistently do extremely well in the box office<sup><a href="#cite">9</a></sup>.</p>
        <h3>Author Names Comparison</h3>
        <p>A curious incident of information that we came across in our data gathering was the number of authors that went by their initials or a pseudonym in the two categories. We decided to differentiate between authors that disguised their name by using their initials (as JK Rowling was encouraged to do to hide her gender in order to appeal to young male readers<sup><a href="#cite">10</a></sup></p>
